# Scala-99-problems

This project is inteded to be a single place of storage for all of my solutions to the scala 99 problems, which can be found [here](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)
I am attempting to work through these problems as a way of strenghtening my scala knowledge and skills as I continue to learn the language and its concepts, especially
functional programming. I will be committiong these solutions prior to reading those provided, so they may not be the "best" but hopefully as I get further along
I will find that my solutions begin to get closer to those recommended by the author of the challenge.
